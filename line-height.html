  <h1>Notes</h1>
  <p>Div is a block element while span is an inline
    Trbl
    Width and height are only applied to block level elements
    Inline-block items have width & height  and also they are not placed in a new line(combining the properties of both block and inline)
    Two divs will be placed adjacent to one another if no space is applied between them and will be have a little margin between if space is applied.
    How can we apply overflow only in x-direction?
    Padding and width cause width of the element to increase in content-box but not in border-box.
    What is the height of the body if not set manually?
    Em is relative to current element font-size while rem is relative to rootâ€™s font-size. Whereas pixel is an absolute unit and percentage is relative to the parent dimensions.
